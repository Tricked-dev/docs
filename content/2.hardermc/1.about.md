# About

A plugin that makes beating minecraft harder,

You can download it from the [ko-fi shop](https://ko-fi.com/s/913dcf72ab) or compile it yourself from Github!

You can purchase a pre-compiled version of the latest HarderMC release instead of compiling it yourself. This version allows you to use HarderMC on a public commercial server, whereas the GitHub version requires you to keep the server private. To learn more about HarderMC, visit their GitHub page at https://github.com/Tricked-dev/HarderMC.
